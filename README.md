## Archived packages

This repository contains an archive of internal packages that constituted the original 2017 version of OctoTask. Read the [2017 announcement post](https://medium.com/@ericsimons/khulnasoft-online-vs-code-ide-for-angular-react-7d09348497f4) which covers the initial core functionality, feature set and motivations behind the project.

Curious how that technology works? We recommend [reading the write-up](https://medium.com/@ericsimons/introducing-5x-faster-than-yarn-npm-and-runs-natively-in-browser-cc2c39715403) we did and exploring the code in this GitHub repo.
